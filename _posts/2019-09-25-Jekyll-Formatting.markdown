This lab gave my remarkably less trouble than the previous labs to finish. For this lab I copied most of the files from the Framework and added them to my own code. There are some parts I am not satisfied with yet, such as the cover page's formatting and the favicon not displaying the picture that I found. I will try to work through these problems and see if I can find a solution to them on my own. I used the Long Haul formatting for this as I heard that it has had the least amount of problems adapting.
