Working with City of Hope Outreach ( COHO ) on this project really opened my eyes on the ways that non-profit organizations help the community. During our discussions at our meetings together they told us all the different ways that they help out in the community so we could get a better idea of what they do and what they needed from us in our project. It was a little shocking to see just how many problems that COHO was trying to fix in the community, such as finding housing for undocumented immigrants. With so many different areas that they were trying to help they needed to be able to minimize all the time spent working on paperwork in the office and maximize their time out in the community.
After learning about this and how they would spend days in the office sorting and filing paperwork and filling out forms I realized that our project can provide a great deal of help for them. With our electronic kiosk system that tracks the hours that volunteers work and auto-generates reports, we can shave off a lot of time that would have been spent doing this by hand. Instead of the office spending a week adding together all of the hours volunteered in different places by hand and trying to calculate values that they needed to receive grants, our project would do this for them. I am really proud of the work that we ended up with so that COHO can worry less about paperwork and spend more time and resources providing help in the form of education, food, shelter, and many more things, to people in need in our community.
