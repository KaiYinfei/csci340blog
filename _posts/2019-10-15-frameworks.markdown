Impression of the Frameworks:
- Ruby-on-rails, Django, and Flask seem like they will be the most simple frameworks as python and ruby are more simple languages without long lines of code to perform simple tasks; however, without using these myself I don't know how these will fit our clients needs.
- ASP.net: My team really likes this framework and after downloading it and doing the tutorial myself I like this one as well. I encountered no problems during the tutorial and it all ran pretty well. Even though I need to learn C# for this I think it won't be too difficult.
- Laravel: This framework is the one I don't know how to feel about the most. I didn't try this one out and I don't know PHP at all so I don't think I'll be using this one.
